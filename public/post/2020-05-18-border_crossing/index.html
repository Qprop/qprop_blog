				<p>May has been a strenuous month getting to read. Moving from highly interesting and captivating reads in April starting with <em>The New Silk Roads: The Present and Future of the World</em>. I have not done its review but probably won&rsquo;t because I was left in awe of the silk roads, just read it let not reviews tell you otherwise. A whole new understanding of the East will enlighten you.</p>

<p>It has been a while since my love for history has been aroused this much, the search into the past.</p>
<p>So riding from such epitomes of mental engagement to a fiction I found rather slow, did not justice at all to my psyche in May. To be honest I have struggled reading <em>Border Crossing</em>. Hope I will get to do justice to its review.</p>
<p><em>Fiction</em></p>
<p>Setting is in North of England, in a city that is not London come to think of it no mention of where exactly it was.
We meet up with a child Psychologist who one breezy morning talking a walk, rescues someone on from the river.
When he gets to meet him in hospital later, it is a former patient of his. Is it a coincidences that 15 years later he meets the young man Danny.
Tom&rsquo;s psycho-analysis had led to the conviction of Danny for murder of an old lady when he was 10 years old.</p>
<p>This leads to a path of more discovery and investigation by Tom to finding out what really happened. Danny who is now registered as Ian for his own protection by the parole board, insists that he has sessions with Tom.
Which makes Tom dig further, bringing forth the events of the murder of Elizabeth 15 years ago.</p>
<p>In the end Tom, losses his wife through divorce not really related to Danny&rsquo;s reemergence but his marriage has been straining for a while.
They have not gotten a child with his wife Lauren and the strain pulls them apart Lauren moves to London and Tom stays back in North London.</p>
<p>Finally Tom, gets closure that Danny did really commit the crime. Though it seems Danny has psychotic bouts now and then. Tom is trying to start a new life and realizes he might not be able to fully cover his past but he is going to try.</p>
<p>Ending with Tom discovering himself all over again.</p>
<p><em>My thoughts</em></p>
<p>Like watching movies which you loss the plot in between, that is what happened as I was reading this.
I thought I would get to experience psychology marvels but was rather disappointed.
Looking forward to my next read though.</p>
