				<p><em>Fiction</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was not sleepy so midnight of 5th April I start reading to push the hours before slumber kicks in. 
Woe unto me I end up 8 hours later having not have slept but read the book through out the night, loving the story line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Setup in the late 80&rsquo;s to 90&rsquo;s Nigeria backdrop, we are introduced to Yejide wife to Akin. Who are the proverbial love at first sight couple.
But the intrigues that underpins their marriage have a shaky foundation. Four years without blessings of additional member of the family is causing a strain to the couple especially to Yejide.
This calls for intervention from both extended families, forcing Yejide to be become first wife as Akin is handed a second wife by the mother.
Shaking an already dicey situation even further.</p>
<p>Akin decides to be scrupulous, he hatches a plan that includes his brother. Ends up having Yejide pregnant and in the processing unfortunately losing his second wife, with whom he did not have any feelings at all for.</p>
<p>As fate would have it their daughter does not survive beyond 5 months of infancy.
Again the betrayals and deceit take center stage and they are blessed with a boy, only to be diagnosed with sickle cell disease.
Further medical test confirm that Akin is not a carrier of the gene, raising a lot of suspicion.</p>
<p>Unfortunately they end up losing their son, which leaves Yejide jaded and forlorn. Though she is blessed with another third child a girl.
The tests are not good and is also diagnosed with sickle cell disease.
Throwing her into a state of no longer getting involved with the daughter eventually she separates and moves away. Not knowing whether her daughter dies or not. She is invited to Akin&rsquo;s fathers burial and she will use the opportunity how things happened with her daughter Rotimi.</p>
<p>Following the intrigues of the various families involved plot twist and turns.</p>
<p>Tackling issues from stigma for young couples without kids, polygamy and impotence.</p>
