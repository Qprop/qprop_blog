Though scratching inside your ears to relieve the itchy feeling comes close.

      <description>The numerous empty shelves we have witnessed across the various countries in the supermarkets is really a spectacal. At first you would think it is black friday at the start of the year all over. But no the jostling and hustling each other over tissue paper was not because of great offers. On slaught of probable lock down after what we have witnessed in China, might have caused a scare. Neanderthal being in us kicked in, the animal instinct the quick impulisive brain took over, in what Daniel Kahneman book Thinking, Fast and Slow terms as the first system.</description>

      <description>BEAUTY OF LANGUAGEUnder the tree scenarios play a lot in my mind, questioning and marveling at the interesting facets and crevices of the world. The complex nature of which we find ourselves in, dynamism, mystism, elusions and perfections all sewn into one. One would be forgiven for not appreciating all the asthetics that come from the universe.
Communication is at the core of human societies, cultures and being. The constant longing for expression of self to the universe, seeking attention or addressing a need.</description>

      <description>At times when am busy with daily task or basically seated under a tree borrowing from my mentor Isaac Newton, always waiting for something to fall. Hopeful to squeal Eureka.
Am a statistician/data analyst by day and data science enthusiast by night.
 Mental journeys shuttling between utopia, dystopia and bordering paranoia.
 I have been fiddling about the idea of a blog. Nothing fancy just my own space where I pour my thoughts, musings, perturbation and amusements.</description>
