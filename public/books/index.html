<p>Beeing somewhat an avid reader, I usually get queries on books I can suggest to people for them to read.</p>
<p>So I would recommend and eventually realised most of what I recommend I need to track them. So the simple table below contains titles I have read. Not a comprehensive list though and it has more than enough.</p>
<p>I will try to update as much as possible.</p>
