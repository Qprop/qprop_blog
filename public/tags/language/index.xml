      <description>BEAUTY OF LANGUAGEUnder the tree scenarios play a lot in my mind, questioning and marveling at the interesting facets and crevices of the world. The complex nature of which we find ourselves in, dynamism, mystism, elusions and perfections all sewn into one. One would be forgiven for not appreciating all the asthetics that come from the universe.
Communication is at the core of human societies, cultures and being. The constant longing for expression of self to the universe, seeking attention or addressing a need.</description>
