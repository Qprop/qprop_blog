      <description>Beeing somewhat an avid reader, I usually get queries on books I can suggest to people for them to read.
So I would recommend and eventually realised most of what I recommend I need to track them. So the simple table below contains titles I have read. Not a comprehensive list though and it has more than enough.
I will try to update as much as possible.</description>
