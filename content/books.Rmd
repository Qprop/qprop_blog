```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


Beeing somewhat an avid reader, I usually get queries on books I can suggest to people for them to read.

So I would recommend and eventually realised most of what I recommend I need to track them. So the simple table below contains titles I have read. Not a comprehensive list though and it has more than enough.

I will try to update as much as possible.


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(readr)
library(readxl)
library(DT)
library(dplyr)

dt <- read_xlsx("My Book Library.xlsx", sheet = "Library")
dt$Date <- as.Date(dt$Date)
dt <- arrange(dt, desc(Date))
```



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
datatable(dt, filter = 'top', options = list(
  pageLength = 10, autoWidth = TRUE
))
```
