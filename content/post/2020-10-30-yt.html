<h1>Determine what interesting stuff we can deduce</h1>
<p>Trying to figure out what interesting things I can figure out from the data available. I have been following Mr. Able Mutua’s channel since he started in the beginning of the year.
Seemed interesting to start my exploratory discovery of what data has to present us.</p>
<p>Just about snippet description of who Abel is though I know I will outright fail. Since when you have an orator a story teller in a language the audience understands.
Spins stories one string at a time taking you back and forth in a roller coaster of “Pause” remember that let me take you back to so and so date. Inches you painfully albeit beautifully till the crescendo of the story when the final string gets woven.</p>
<p>Back to my romanticization with data and the beauty it beholds.</p>
<p>I need to get his youtube’s channel ID, for this I did a search of his name <code>Abel Mutua</code>. Then looked at the individual unique ID’s I got.</p>
<p>As always there is something to find out from the data, he seems to have done a lot of interviews and are hosted in different users channel and mentions on other channels.</p>
<p>Data was downloaded from youtube API on <code>2020-10-30</code>, since this is youtube and it is prone to changing.</p>

<p>I have noticed some of the videos do not have titles that bear his name, but that is not the main reason we are doing this. Now the top channel looks like his channel and we have the channel ID. UC4tjY2tTltEKePusozUxtSA, Abel Mutua, 51 .</p>
<p>Though we could just have picked the channel ID from youtube directly copy and paste from the website. SO much for automation if you do this.</p>
