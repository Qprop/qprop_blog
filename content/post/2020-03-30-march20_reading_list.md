The month I found myself starting with a reading list of 11 physical books to read. Clearly my next couple months have been sorted out. I am used to reading while on transit started some while back when my commute to and from work was close to two and half hours, rather than complain and indulge on online chatter profile stalking and all other manner of utter online social media shenanigans. Book always at hand has become synonymous with my persona, could be it is my way of avoiding idle conversation created by boredom in traffic. Happened to attend training, in the course of the two day worth of training. My instructor noticed my read then, definitely it intrigued her and it started our conversation long story short the next day she brought me 5 books.

My picks and read for march, not really related at all. I prefer alternating between genres fiction, history, biography et cetera.

**1. Making Cents**

Money, wealth and richness very different things, elicits very many debates. As you might have intuitively guessed yes this is a book about wealth through money. Get your house in order, plan organize your finances at the different levels.

1. Change your perception of what money easy, erase the learnings of your former child growing where money was not talked about. Be deliberate in your speech about money either to yourself or to others. Accept that this can both be grown or lost.

2. Write down your assets and liabilities look at the difference are you at a profit that is surplus or at a loss with negative amount. It is a matter of being truthful to yourself and admitting and jotting down all this what you have in terms of physical assets am not including things like phones here or TV and liabilities here being loans and expenses. Do not be worried when the figures shock you that takes us to the next step.

3. Budget: One before you budget, track your expenses write down your expenses each time you pay or spend money be diligent in this. I have been tracking every cent I spend for now 5 years in a simple excel sheet I use. For one or two months do your tally. Step one is done you know your expenses, next now is skimming to check through which are these that are very high. Gives you all the idea what is a want and what is a need. 
Now take your time to create the need list of what is necessary expenses you need eliminate want, check what can be reduced. Include payments of loans, including and not limited to those friends or relative sorted you out from a fix. FYI write all this done the amount have the expense and budget side by side. 

4. Investment: We look at places you can increase your income here is where, I do not have a lot of input because there are so many investment vehicles. What I can tell you is do your research on the investment and again ask ask ask. Though Waceke did not include this at investment personally I include it here any extra source of income from your hobbies *side hustle*.

5. Giving: Share this knowledge, share this wealth, teach. Learn to have a surplus mentality by giving, this eradicates the poverty mentality where you believe you have little and not enough to share.


Finally practice the above all the time, lest it becomes something you read and forgot.


**2. Dance Dance Dance**
